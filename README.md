How to Install (for users):

Download: Download the library as a ZIP file from your GitHub repository (using the "Code" -> "Download ZIP" option).

Install (via Arduino IDE):

Open the Arduino IDE.

Go to Sketch -> Include Library -> Add .ZIP Library...

Select the downloaded ZIP file.

The Arduino IDE will automatically install the library in the correct location.

Install (Manually):

Unzip downloaded file.

Rename the unzipped folder from BMDBLEController-main to BMDBLEController.

Move the BMDBLEController folder to your Arduino libraries folder (usually Documents/Arduino/libraries).

Restart Arduino IDE: Restart the Arduino IDE to ensure the library is recognized.

Summary of Corrected Steps:

Repository Name: The most important correction is to name your repository's root folder BMDBLEController (without the -ESP32 suffix).

library.properties URL: Update the url field in library.properties to point to the correct repository URL.

Installation Instructions: Make sure your README.md provides clear instructions on how to install the library, both via the Arduino IDE's "Add .ZIP Library" feature and manually.

By following these corrected steps, your library will be properly structured for use with the Arduino IDE and the Arduino Library Manager. The ESP32 platform specification is handled correctly within the library.properties file (architectures=esp32), so there's no need to include it in the repository name itself.
